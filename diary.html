<p style="color: white"> I'm making a website.I'm not sure why. Actually I do know. I have a terrible feeling of falling behind on the world of programming, even tough it's a losing battle, the game was rigged from the start. So as I'm writing this I not even hosted my website yet, not even finished the styling of it (fuck CSS), I'm just testing my waters, learning how to make stuff, add .mp3 files, .mp4 files, hyperlinks, etc. Things that even your grandma knows how to make, but please be patient, I'll figure things out, eventually. </p>

<p style="color: white">I can't even commit this to github, I'm a failure, I should just give up already, I don't know how to host this, how to buy a domain, etc. Why am I this retarded?</p>
